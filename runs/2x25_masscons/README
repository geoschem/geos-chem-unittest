This directory is the GEOS-Chem run directory for 2x2.5 mass conservation test.
This directory can be used with GEOS-FP or MERRA-2 meteorology.

   NOTE: This is a CO2 simulation with the initial conditions being 370 ppm
   everywhere.  From this simulation, we can print out the values of total
   CO2 every few hours.  This will let us determine if GEOS-Chem is
   conserving mass.

The various input files (e.g. HEMCO_Config.template, HISTORY.rc, etc.) are
stored in ../shared_inputs/CO2.  This allows us to keep a single set of 
these files in one location, for convenience.  A new HEMCO_Config.rc file will 
be created from the HEMCO_Config.template file each time the unit tester is 
run.

A new input.geos file will also be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.

We recommend copying this directory via the gcCopyRunDirs script and to run 
this test from the copied run directory.
